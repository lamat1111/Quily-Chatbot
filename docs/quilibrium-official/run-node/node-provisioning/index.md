# Node Provisioning

Node provisioning is the process of installing, configuring, and running the Quilibrium node software on your server.
There are several methods available, each suited to different levels of experience and operational needs.

Before proceeding, make sure your server meets the [system requirements](/docs/run-node/system-requirements) and you have opened the required [firewall ports](/docs/run-node/quick-start#default-ports-to-open-on-firewall).

## Provisioning Methods

| Method | Description | Maintenance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [**QTools**](/docs/run-node/node-provisioning/qtools) (Recommended) | Automated provisioning and management tool for Quilibrium nodes. | Managed updates and service orchestration. |
| [**Manual Install**](/docs/run-node/node-provisioning/manual-install) | Download the binary, set up a service, and manage updates yourself. Guides for [Linux](/docs/run-node/node-provisioning/manual-install/linux) and [macOS](/docs/run-node/node-provisioning/manual-install/macos). | You handle all updates and configuration. |
| [**Legacy Methods**](/docs/run-node/node-provisioning/legacy) | Older scripts that *may* still be functional. Not actively maintained. | Limited or no ongoing maintenance. |
