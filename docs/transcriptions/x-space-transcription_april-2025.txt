(00:00) have uh quite a bit of specific cases we're going to test out as we as we roll this out But uh the core premise is that this is going to be what essentially the network will uh proceed to do on mainet the moment that the cut cutoff frame has been reached Um we just have preempted the the rebuild of the store into the hybrid graph already So we can we can skip that conversion step as as we test this out Um for those who are unfamiliar with Quilibrium uh I just want to mention real quick Quiltrium is a peer-to-p peer
(00:31) network for confidential compute that makes it easy to run services on the web that keeps your data private Uh including from those who build services on equilibrium whether it's a group chat application like Quorum a video game matchmaking service a hobby hobbyist form or any other application on the web Now uh I try to use these broadcasts to talk about uh equilibrium in uh more plain terms Uh we have gotten a lot of feedback about the um streams that happen on Twitch and uh on on Twitter itself with the uh video broadcasts and
(01:05) those tend to be more developer oriented and so they tend to be a bit more uh technically complex Uh and so we're doing these spaces to try to uh answer these questions that people have in a bit more of a clear accessible way So I'm going to go ahead and uh jump right in We actually have uh quite a few questions uh this time around which is awesome And so uh I'm going to try to lump a few of them together when when there's a lot of overlap so that we don't end up like answering the same question twice Um so I'm going to go
(01:37) ahead and get started with one that there's a few different questions around um specifically uh regarding the fund raise that Quilia Inc is doing uh for the company itself Um so the one of the questions works out like this uh with a pretext They said uh there was a lot of excitement in recent months been around the equity raise for Q Inc that created a lot of FOMO and I understand previously due to legal reasons you could not disclose or announce Um now that you've hired a couple devs and other resources is the
(02:05) raise complete or initial round complete Are you still bootstrapping And were you overwhelmed or underwhelmed with the equity investment interest given the overall crypto market and decentralized tech bearish sentiment Um so unfortunately I can't actually answer that question Uh like you had noted yourself there are uh legal reasons that we can't discuss the details of a fund raise until the round has fully closed Uh we are obviously still in the process of that But uh when that actually closes out be happy to answer all the details
(02:36) Just cannot do that yet Um but I did want to acknowledge that those questions were being asked and I I didn't want to just simply be ignored Um so let's dive into questions that can be answered Um the first is uh will emissions drop after the 21 update and how much do you expect them to drop if so I can answer that actually directly So because we have been doing the conversion of the uh mainet state in the test net uh environment we actually have a really good measurement of what the overall network state will look like in terms of
(03:10) total storage And so at this point given how many uh gigabytes of data have roughly been encoded into world state in the uh overall hyperraph of the network we're actually looking at an emissions rate of roughly uh 102 quill uh per emission interval which is 10 per 10 seconds uh globally So uh we're seeing a very significant drop off with the 21 update Um when can we use the Quorum mobile beta Uh I mentioned this in a couple places but happy to mention it again Uh if you haven't signed up for the uh beta we have a form uh that we've posted a
(03:50) few times on Twitter Uh feel free to sign up Uh all it asks for is an email so that we can uh get you set up on either TestFlight or Google Play Store uh for the beta But also um if you want to use a uh like just an unlocked unshackled uh deoogled Android phone well we can also send you the APK directly Uh but to answer the question of uh when uh we are going to start rolling this out uh the evening of Friday So in other words tomorrow Uh so uh stay on the lookout if you already um signed up for the beta Uh you should be
(04:25) getting an email around how to access that uh tomorrow Uh somebody also asked "How long have you bu been building equilibrium for?" Uh so yeah this is this is more of the deep lore Uh I actually like started the origins of what equilibrium came to be uh about seven years ago which is really crazy to think about now Uh obviously like at that time it was not even remotely what it is today It it was more of a like hobby project and the original goal was to just build an alternative to Discord We didn't even have like the
(05:00) notion of a peer-to-peer version at that time It was uh basically a federated version Felt kind of similar to Matrix Um but yeah it it definitely changed a lot over uh seven years in ultimately becoming a uh AWS alternative Uh can you make an approximate cost comparison speaking of AWS between Q storage and uh AWS S3 or other cloud providers Yeah Uh so we're trying to stay as competitive as possible with uh AWS AWS has uh relatively cheap pricing for the storage itself where they get you as the egress Uh so if you have a lot of requests on
(05:40) that data it ends up getting really expensive really fast And so what we're doing is we're going to emulate their free tier in terms of uh how much data you can store without having to pay a fee Uh so we're going to be uh specifically offering uh 5 GB of storage free and then uh subsequent data added on will have its own pricing tiers Um how that pans out with respect to egress is that the network itself has essentially um a model where when you're doing queries you're paying to evaluate the query for that data And the way that
(06:22) we do that with our uh S3 compatibility layer is we do have some upper level caching So if you're doing um if you're doing like a public S3 bucket uh then we have additional layers of caching that makes the data readily available without having to reexecute queries Uh so the overall cost is going to be uh very deeply competitive in terms of egress because we're essentially um underwriting the egress when it comes down to uh executing the query on the network but when it's actually being served at the uh at the proxy layer
(06:56) where where the data is basically being served up exactly like if you put uh S3 through a uh API gateway or uh some other kind of layer to proxy to it Um we're we're basically cutting past all the costs around that so that it is as cheap as humanly possible Uh our our target is to basically compete with the current cheapest alternative to S3 which is uh Cloudflare's R2 Uh what is the utility of the Quill token Uh the utility of the Quill token is to deploy uh data applications execute uh applications on the network
(07:34) Basically it's it's the network's equivalent to uh a unit of interchange for performing whatever interaction needs to be done on the network If companies and users can pay in fiat or stable coins for services how do you see the tokens utility evolving Uh so that's actually that comes back around to the notion of what is distinct between equilibrium inc and equilibrium the protocol Equilibrium the protocol is the decentralized uh MPC platform as a service Equilibrium Inc is a company that provides managed services that run
(08:09) on top of equilibrium the protocol And so our S3 compatibility API is a convenience layer so that people can store data on a hyperraph in a efficiently packed format that retains all the you know security properties that the encrypted hyperraph offers So in other words if you are wanting to store data in a private bucket versus a public bucket you'd be storing it on the hyperraph in the verifiably encrypted format So you can rest assured that the data is stored exactly the way you intend it to be but is only accessible
(08:38) to you Um but when it comes to how Quilia Inc is surfacing that uh we try to make it feasible for people who want to actually like have predictable billing in terms of whatever their uh regional currency is that they can do so So so it's not as much of a mental shift to move from a platform like AWS where they are paying in fiat to uh using the Q console and the uh related managed services Uh same same kind of concept you're paying in fiat but we also do offer the ability to pay in the quill and wrapped quill
(09:20) tokens Um so what is quorum apex and how will it work exactly Uh quorum apex is basically going to be our alternative to discord nitro Uh so there's going to be some uh unique benefits uh in terms of like what an Apex subscriber can do on uh Quorum But I think one of the most compelling things that is surprisingly not something Discord really does is uh when you when you for example boost a server on uh Discord uh or subscribe to a space on Quorum Um both of those things have very similar perks that are associated with it But the distinction
(10:02) for Quorum is that if you are a subscriber to a space the space actually gets a rev split of the overall Quill tokens that were used to pay for the Apex subscription So in other words uh it's what basically Nitro Boosting should have been in the first place like if you make a really great um community why wouldn't you uh get some sort of reward in the in the subscriptions that you've received And so that's that's the way that we're approaching it with Quorum Apex Uh you pay for a month of Quorum Apex and it splits out to up to
(10:38) four subscriptions to uh different spaces that you're in and you can obviously subscribe multiple times to the same space same way you would do with nitro boosting Okay Uh now we've got a few questions that uh are from specific individuals and I'm going to go ahead and uh like lump them all together by the by the asker So uh DeFiquare first off uh absolutely love the questions that you asked Uh you also were on the stream on uh Tuesday and it was uh like I love those questions Uh so happy to answer these as well Um someone living
(11:17) in a dictatorship uh country that has no freedom of speech Uh being an activist can put them in jail for trying to express political opinions Hosting a blog on Q for journalists will make it impossible for the governments to track any IPs Will they be safe 100% Um so I'll I'll break that down into a couple of different concepts that are important to understand uh people try to find privacy on the web in different ways uh today even like they'll use uh proxies uh like either a VPN service or they're using something
(11:49) like tour and depending on the nature of where you are what you're doing um what you're intending to do over that proxy and how you're doing it all has different effects that can potentially expose you Um tour in of itself is kind of notoriously known as something that's bought to hell by state actors Uh but those state actors you know are in certain countries They're not in all countries And so for example if you are a journalist that is wanting to um you know expose like a report from a whistleblower that is based out of like
(12:29) I don't know uh maybe Brazil um or or Chile or something like that Uh on tour you don't have state actors that are flooding the network with uh peers that are uh from those countries And so demasking the identity of that journalist or the whistleblower is practically impossible Whereas if it was somebody based out of the US or Germany uh which are the two major countries that have basically uh dominated tour in terms of uh node coverage to uh unmask identities uh it's it's actually you could consider yourself compromised And so why I
(13:09) mentioned this is that equilibrium is a permissionless protocol people can run nodes anywhere Uh we leverage approaches that make it much harder in comparison to something like tour to uh unmask the identity of somebody who has uh transmitted data on the network Um but that being said like there there's still going to be some degree of self-sufficiency and self um awareness that you're going to have to have when you are engaging in any sort of interaction on the network Um one thing I can I can explain in simpler terms is
(13:46) if somebody hosted a website on Q for example and that website had a uh you know JavaScript that does browser fingerprinting and identifies a user Um that's what the creator of that site can do Uh equilibrium does not prevent that because all of what equilibrium is being used for in that case is hosting a website So I I want to be very explicit that like being a safe 100% still requires you know some self-sufficiency in terms of understanding what you're doing in order to uh avoid any sort of like overall uh
(14:26) surveillance If a big tech company has a big number of users let's say 100 million daily active users if they wanted to migrate to Q will Q be able to handle such high traffic of users And if we said two billion users like Facebook is this uh theoretically possible Um so realistically the way that we have designed Q is very similar to the shared nothing architecture of silob And what is important to understand about that approach in the design is that the resource locking that would be required to um manage an
(15:01) individual's user's resources does not interfere with uh any other users resources And that statement is kind of uh complex on the surface but I'll explain it more like this Um when you're using an ERC20 on Ethereum for example um the way that that works is it's a smart contract that has storage that basically provides a mapping of all the users addresses to a given balance of whatever ERC20 that uh contract is referring to And if you make a modification like you send like you transfer a token you're just updating the uh balance values on
(15:39) those two different accounts uh in the mapping of those account addresses to the balances And in order to do that at a contract level in on Ethereum this is happening in a single threaded execution context So they don't have to do any locking Um but the downside is well you can just literally look at how many transactions per second under high load that Ethereum can actually handle it It ends up being a very se severe bottleneck And so our application design is meant to be u like as relatively conflict free as um possible so that if
(16:16) you did have you know say two billion users that are individually creating transactions that do not have conflicts with one another uh they can all happen in parallel instead of having to be processed in serial Um there were two questions around cost and uh one is the cost of hosting a website on Q Uh the other is if there's free hosting options available Uh like I mentioned earlier our uh Q storage um service does have a free tier that is essentially like 5 gigabytes of data free Um a while not every website would necessarily uh be
(16:55) able to take advantage of that to host their website in full uh for free there's certainly quite a few out there that uh have relatively minimal payloads that that could fit within the free tier Are there additional costs for security backups or performance upgrades Um no That's that's not really like a that's not something that we tack on Like the notion of um replication amongst peers is baked into the protocol You will not have consensus if you don't have a sufficient coverage of data on the network Security is also like it's a
(17:28) mandatory component of the network The nature of how data is stored on the network itself is through verifiable encryption And so uh yeah no these are not um these are not value ads These are table stakes for us Uh how does equilibrium ensure fast loading times for websites Uh that's that's a little bit more complicated of a question in the sense that like the Q storage API uh in the uh public bucket proxy which is what would be used to ensure fast loading times for websites uh that's that's more of an engineering
(17:59) question of the managed service rather than equilibrium the protocol itself Uh in terms of like fast execution of queries on the network uh that's obviously going to be contingent on a number of factors including the nodes that are processing that query at a at a given time But it's something that as the network continues to grow uh continues to improve Uh yeah so there's a couple more questions that relate specifically to web hosting Again these are all specific to uh Q storage Uh so this is this is more of a question about the Q storage
(18:33) offering Um but in short yes you can you can host websites on Q storage um the overall response time like the latency that we're measuring for Q storage we're trying to keep it at like in terms of latency for time to return data like basically when we've fetched the data relevant to the uh what relevant to the request and returned it back to the requester Uh we're trying to keep things in terms of tens of milliseconds in response times Um and so we we employ a lot of uh layered caching techniques to try to um minimize the amount of time it
(19:08) takes to serve a response Um can people migrate an existing website Um yeah Uh as long as it's like a static page that's that's the thing that Q storage can support in terms of like running a back-end service on Q That's that's something that would have to happen at a later time Uh do I need to buy a domain separately Um yeah we're not offering domain hosting like a domain management or anything like that yet Um we we'll give you the necessary like CNAME values you have to configure in order to uh route your domain to the
(19:43) um public bucket but in terms of uh like actually offering uh domain services no Um there's there's a few good hosts out there and depending on the nature of like what your concerns are with respect to uh domain providers uh there's there's certainly good recommendations out there that are a bit more uh based and redpilled if you will in terms of uh what they're willing to tolerate and who they're willing to tell to off with respect to uh any sort of legal requests Um is there a step-by-step guide or tutorial videos available Uh not yet we
(20:19) are going to uh you know start doing a lot of developer facing content after the 21 release But yeah uh thank you for all those questions Uh like I I really love how like uh deep you're willing to dive into this in in in your questions Um next user was a username of BBB I think that's how it worked out Um first is uh will customers pay in the quill token and if yes are they buying it in the background or pay but paying in dollar what exactly is happening there Um okay so I think this is again related to questions about Q console um
(20:54) and that's perfectly fine the uh way that we're handling that in terms of what um users are paying like if a user pays Quill Inc in fiat to utilize the network uh with with the managed services Q Inc has its own amount of tokens that we have earned by running nodes the same as everyone else Uh and so in terms of like how we actually will pay for services on the network directly we are paying for services on the network directly the same as anybody else deploying anything to the network Um we're we're not a specially
(21:28) privileged actor in this space Uh so literally like if somebody is um wanting to host a website and they're using the Q managed services and deploying it through Q console it's still ultimately settling to the network as uh data on the hyperraph and that means that we have to pay for that data on the hyperraph and that data gets paid for in the network native token Uh the next question was uh when can we expect the website revamp with the new brand design for the design team Um more on that soon Uh it's still in progress
(22:05) but uh we're we're getting pretty hopeful about the timing of things but I I can't say for sure uh when all of it will be ready But we're going to basically roll it out all at once um rather than like peace meal things out so that it doesn't cause any uh confusion because we're we're applying this rebranding and redesign to everything uh and and very excited to present that but uh we're we're going to wait until everything is all in one ready to go Uh how is the Q token being used as a utility token Uh and what exactly is the
(22:42) utility that the token provides in response to storage KMS and S3 compatibility Uh yeah so like I said uh when data is being stored to the hyperraph uh that directly uh corresponds to a fee When uh applications are deployed to the network like in terms of like these QCL based applications that also uh requires a fee when you execute applications on the network that requires a fee When you um query data on the network if you're not running a node that is holding that data yourself uh that also requires a fee So
(23:15) like just like any other crypto protocol that's um out there like it is a fee consumptionoriented network So like you still have to um pay to use the network All right Um I think that is all the questions that I had uh lined up So let's see if there was any more Um okay So I'll go ahead and open the floor to anybody who uh wants to ask questions on the space Um obviously you don't have to jump up if you don't feel comfortable uh talking in public but uh if you do great If not then you can leave your questions for uh
(24:08) the uh next post where we uh schedule the next pace or or take it to the stream on uh Sunday All right fair enough So um yeah uh like I said this week's going to be a very intense week We're going to be rolling out uh the release candidate of 21 Um tomorrow we're going to be uh rolling out the Quorum mobile beta There's a lot in flight So uh very exciting week very exciting week to follow and uh I look forward to uh seeing you all again this Sunday uh where I'll be going through how to build applications directly on Q
(25:08) with QCL All right everybody
