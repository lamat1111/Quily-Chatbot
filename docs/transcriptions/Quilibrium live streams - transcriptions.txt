Transcript:
(00:00) one first uh the first thing is going to be talking about uh a little bit of a history lesson uh I know a lot of people have seen some interesting events over the past few weeks and uh more events happening today that have been uh pretty pretty hard to stomach if uh especially if this is your first uh season in crypto um and I think it's important to understand I've said this many times and you'll hear this from pretty much every single person who has ever been an employee at uh you know a ycombinator style company uh or coinbase
(00:30) specifically because uh Brian loves to talk about this a lot but um it's it's a really true phrase which is It's Never As Good As It Seems but it's also never as bad as it seems even when things seem really rough and you know everybody is saying this is the end we're it's so over um the the reality is is that like there's always going to be extreme emotions tied into speculative Bubbles and that is what we are in we are in a speculative bubble and we've been in one for quite some time and so one thing I want to like level set with people is to
(01:01) have their expectations in line when they think about this industry in a broader narrative um and more specifically what we're thinking about and how we think about the nature of what equilibrium Inc is going to be uh playing in the part of writing the stories of that future and so I want to uh just draw a couple of parallels real quick uh first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to switch this over and hope to god it works uh of course it didn't okay so yeah I've been having some troubles with stre streamlabs let me uh
(01:31) let me get that sorted out hey there we go okay so um anyway I've got AAL draw open because we're going to have a couple of items that uh I'm going to draw out as I paint the picture of uh three different stories from history uh that inspire me a lot and make me think a lot about what the future of crypto is going to look like uh so to start things off uh we'll wind the CL uh clock back to uh 1970 in the 1970s there was this idea of The Homebrew computer like people were first starting to learn about uh computers in
(02:09) in like a more uh personalized context cuz before you know you had like the eniac and these big uh vacuum tube filled machines and then the Advent of the transistor started to shrink technology down so these computers were not actually taking up the full size of a room and eventually like things were getting down to the mini computer and uh around the 1970s uh technology had gotten to the point where people were actually starting to experiment uh personally like they were starting to build out their own home
(02:38) computers and there were lots of schematics that were uh you know passed around through these home brew clubs and there were also starting to be some consumer oriented hobbyist computer devices but at the end of the day these were all like very very nerdy devices like you had to have like a a breadboard that you hand wrapped and wired yourself and you had these like very huge books that were were like you know guides on how to actually set this all up and people just didn't actually really care like if you were if you were a normal
(03:08) person that was not a nerd that you know you could see these things and you could be like that's really neat but that's never going to sit on my desk like people are saying this is the future but I just don't see it but one thing you have to think about is what came out of that so during the 1970s there was one particular uh Homebrew Club The Homebrew Computer Club very aptly named and uh there was a trio of individuals there that ultimately became the founders of Apple Inc and they introduced a personal computer at The Homebrew Computer Club
(03:39) called the apple one and it was pretty uh pretty janky I I've talked about this in uh previous streams and uh actual talks that I've done at like farcon and a talk I gave at coinbase and these uh this this device was a very clunky wooden thing uh and that was the Prototype and but nevertheless it like changed The Narrative of because instead of people having to you know manually build these things themselves it was something instead that people could buy like it was a consumer oriented device and it was something that really started
(04:11) to challenge The Narrative of what a personal computer was and what that actually meant and so you started to see this change in the industry that companies were slowly working towards and building where you had what was the previous you know industry niche of the um mini computer uh and IBM being very slow to pick up on that and then you had the Advent of the personal computer and again IBM was very slow to pick up on that but by around the 1980s the personal computer had started to take off and people were actually using it
(04:42) for things that was uh more than just like geeking out like people were starting to actually use these for financialized applications and so uh as these offshoots started to spring up you started to see competition occur within these industries cuz there was suddenly a influx of money that was you know accumulating from all the different entrance and uh one of the things that was really important to notice is that a lot of engineering went into this because these people were you know obviously talented Hardware engineers
(05:11) and they may have worked in other industries that were adjacent to this but trying to like compress everything down into the most cost economic way for a business to produce it but still a functional means for a consumer to do powerful things that they couldn't do before like back in the day you were doing spreadsheets by hand and now you can do spreadsheets on a computer that can sit on your desk and you can print that out and that was very novel um but ultimately like things started to move Beyond just Basic Finance but there were
(05:39) some companies that couldn't get past that that was their bread and butter they they sold to accountants they sold to uh you know Business Leaders and that was it like that they thought that that was the depth of computing and so you didn't really have a whole lot of people who were like teachers or creative artists or anything like that had quite gotten into the realm of using a personal computer and through the conversations that uh Steve Jobs and others at Apple had with individuals who are working in those Industries he
(06:09) realized that the personal computer was not personal enough that there were things that needed to be done that moved Beyond finance and at the time that was basically received by the industry as a joke people did not think that that was necessary that there wouldn't be money in it that people wouldn't have a computer on every single desk in their home like that this wasn't going to be something meaningful but he thought differently and by consequence Apple quickly seized the entire market for Education seized the entire market for
(06:36) Creative types and ultimately blossomed into the Apple ecosystem that we know and love today and I think about this lesson a lot because it's one of those moments in history where people are looking back at things like uh the early days of crypto where we are you know just beginning to eek out this idea of decentralized finance that we're you know challenging the notion of Fiat rails that challenging the notion of just the sheer concept of interchange of value and ultimately things continue develop and and created
(07:09) new ecosystems you have these new chains that emerge that start to expand the capabilities and start to uh create these new ideas and more complexity and ultimately what I'm seeing is that exact same pattern play out again we are seeing the world of crypto focusing just on finance when you start to see things like people focusing fing on creators like they'll talk about the Creator economy what you'll notice when you listen to what they're saying is that when they talk they are talking about putting creators into a financialized
(07:41) topic like putting art on chain putting uh music onchain and selling these things as nfts they are strictly focused on the financial they're not focused on the things that artists personally care about CU yes to an artist there is a business side to them but they are not strictly in in the business of art they are in the passion of Art and it's these types of things that I feel like our industry is just completely glossing over and it's something that's going to Blindside them when there is actually something much more capable and much
(08:13) more Adept at handling what it is that these individuals actually want to do to pursue their passions vigorously and so this is just one of the three aspects of history that I think is playing out in a little bit of repeating so the way that I think about this is is talking about the axis of what you can do and what happens when the world starts to change that idea the second thing I want to talk about is something that will feel very unfortunately at home right now um the video game crash in 1983 so in the 1980s
(08:53) uh the video game industry was largely dominated by Atari Magnavox and a few others and what essentially was the this idea of like home video game systems that you'd release a new one every couple years you'd be like pushing out a bunch of video games that were like usually brand deals like you know um there was the most infamous one of course was the ET video game that was released during the the ET movie uh and that was uh you know those types of games that were coming out were like mass produced very quickly built uh not
(09:26) very great and by consequence um over time there was this C of people pushing out new consoles pushing out a bunch of free hashes of the same games with the same rules with the same ideas and after a certain point it was reaching this Market saturation level where people did not actually want to buy a new console they didn't want to buy these games because these games sucked and by about 1983 where which was roughly the peak of the video game industry uh they were sitting at about 3.
(09:57) 2 billion in total uh Revenue that year for the video game industry which is quite a bit that's about $10.2 billion um in current dollars but uh in roughly 2 years they completely cratered down to a annual revenue of about 100 million why is that and ultimately what it comes down to is people were being flooded with a bunch of that they didn't want um and it's that simple and so you can again there's this parallel that you can start to see where like right now with um the various hype wav that have happened in crypto you have like the original like
(10:33) Ico hype the nft hype the I mean even defi summer had its own unique hype because it certainly propped a bu a bunch of uh algo Stables that ended up being pieces of that wrecked people's lives and then you have of course the current meta of the meme coins which is starting to again reach that market saturation where people are realizing this is I am just gambling why am I doing this and so we're starting to see like this you know Financial rejection in play obviously there are broader Market uh consequences that are happening right now and people
(11:03) will have all sorts of theories about you know how it's the tariffs that are doing this or it's some other like longer economic story like a recession that's been impending for a while that's playing out but in reality we are actually seeing that same kind of Crash that same video game uh crash that happened in the 1980s and so what I want to talk about with that story is what went wrong and what got fixed what led to the video game era that we know is today because like most people we've played video games and we don't really think about
(11:39) the infamous Atari landfill because that's such a like you know transient moment of History like it's not something that uh you know was the Cornerstone that was the end like we just remember the Atari landfill and gaming was gone of course Gaming's not gone and so what happened uh essentially these analysts were basically you know they were dooming Atari they were dooming magn the Vox because obviously they were in you know bad financial State and they were saying that this is the end of Home gaming industry because
(12:08) in the 1980s as well home computers were starting to rise and so they were blaming home computers and the poor quality of games of course as the reason why the game industry was over and what's interesting about that is that by 1985 there was this small um well I wouldn't say small but there was this uh relatively unknown uh game company uh unless you were like frequenting the uh arcades that uh made mostly playing cards in these arcade games and that was their entire business and they were based out of Japan and
(12:43) they uh re-envisioned how to approach the gaming industry uh and what they thought was we need to think about how American consumers currently see this industry and they see it basically as them getting screwed like they're getting ripped off like they're not getting a good entertainment experience and so what they did is they set up a quality bar where you had to as a game publisher uh you had to meet this Quality Bar before they would license your game to run on their console cuz what was happening with Atari is anybody
(13:12) was just hucking games and there was no Quality Bar at all and so ultimately Nintendo released the uh was the famicom in Japan as the Nintendo entertainment system in the US and they stylized it like a VCR so that people would more associate the common elements of home entertainment systems for like watching movies and things that they already had like strong quality experiences wrapped around uh but instead with video games and so they had the Nintendo seal of quality which was their quality check and gate that
(13:46) prevented crappy games from ending up uh you know being distributed and destroying the industry and of course you know history was made with that the NES is a Cornerstone of video game history nobody uh has like seriously bad things to say about that that moment in time except maybe having to uh blow into the cart too many times because the game didn't want to start but outside of that like it was a watershed moment for the industry it changed how things were done and so I want to talk about this in the lens
(14:15) of what's happening in crypto in the sense that we are seeing that same failure we're seeing the quality failure of both um things like the the memes like not just meme coins but like the mimetic tendency for people to jump on hype trains of like completely unchecked assumptions or completely lack thereof of assumptions like these this financial degeneracy there's just no quality gate on these things that's resulting in people making very poor financial decisions and ultimately like it's it's burning people and it's making people feel like crypto
(14:49) is a scam and that there's nothing good in it and that comes entirely from the fact that we have a lack of quality enforcement so I wanted to talk about that because this was the problem that Nintendo solved that was unique and what positioned them to be so different the final thing that I want to talk about as this story of history repeating was the bubble so in the 199s there was a Cadre of uh early internet companies a lot of people um saw the the early days of the internet as this unique idea that let people exchange
(15:26) information in ways that were much more per personal than you know having to call somebody and and that's all you get maybe maybe a group phone call but that's expensive and so like it was connecting people in unique and interesting ways and it was also introducing multimedia to people in ways that previously it was very much a um you know non-interactive model you would watch TV and there would be big producers of television programs but instead this became something that was more uh interactive and so there were
(15:55) early early companies that were starting to um jump on top of this now of course at the time we didn't have significant bandwidth so there wasn't you know you couldn't do live chats um over video you couldn't have streams like twitch like these things were not yet viable because the technology was lacking at the time but nevertheless the dreamers and the idealists of this created these very large companies youd find them in the field of uh search engines like Google kicking things off altav Vista um Yahoo of course uh you
(16:26) had these e-commerce companies that started to differ iate into small silos like pets.com very very infamously and then you had uh even online delivery services the very first case of online delivery if you want to call it that was actually like Pizza Hut had opened up a online portal where one specific Pizza Hut was running a server that would take these requests in and then they would just basically send it out to all of the different Pizza Hut branches across the country and that was how they kind of like kickstarted the whole idea of
(16:55) online delivery of food and then there was also uh actual online delivery of restaurants that was attempted in the in the late 1990s very few people remember it because it wasn't successful uh and then there was also of course the internet service providers uh like you had your compy serve you had Prodigy you had a America online or AOL uh and then you started to see this shift early 2000 around March or so there were so many of these companies that had propped up these IPOs and they were you know after it all they were
(17:29) trying to dominate the market uh under whatever it was that they were trying to do and realistically they didn't have business plans that panned out under the current state of the technology that existed at the time the progress and trajectory that technology was able to make during that time and of course you know you had broader economic conditions that were starting to push down on things and so by consequence you had what was the dotcom bubble bursting and there were a few companies that had just started shortly before then and often
(18:00) times they were in some of those domains that were ending up uh largely producing a bunch of failures of companies so you had Yahoo and Google you had uh Amazon and eBay and uh besides AOL you had like this Cadre of small internet companies that were starting to get into more Niche Services uh like high-speed Broadband because at the time that was a niche it was expensive and they were laying down the groundwork of things that they knew were going to take a long time to achieve and the market of course punished them significantly but they
(18:32) made the right decisions to ensure that they were in it for the long haul that they were making generational decisions that they'd be able to capture or capitalize on in the years to come when everybody else was making these short-term decisions that were just not feasible for a business and so as a consequence after the bubble bursted and all of these other companies had died out you then had basically Amazon eBay uh PayPal of course from from the eBay generation uh you had uh a few different isps and you had of course Google and Yahoo that were
(19:09) basically dominating the industry and becoming Titans and so this is what I'm basically seeing again to draw a parallel in crypto today uh unlike the other uh two categories where it's the difference of what you can do or a quality enforcement bar in this case it's a planning for for longterm like planning for the long-term generations of what technology is going to be able to enable and so these are the three pillars that I think of historically as playing out in crypto all at the same time and there's a lot of overlap of
(19:47) course in how these stories played out and in the ideas that formed around them but I think it's important to think about these because these parallels are how we are defining what we're doing as a company and what we're doing for the protocol in order to ensure its long-term success and so what I think about in terms of like what you can do in the uh context of what can we enable we think less about Finance Finance is a part of it but Finance is just an application more about what other people need what other Industries
(20:23) need and we think about I don't know why it's Auto completing there that's super annoying uh we think about what type of creative Works can be enabled because when you talk about the problems that technology solves when you're trying to design something if you're designing something just simply for the sake of trying to uh basically create a solution in search of a problem which is something that typically gets flung at uh the crypto crowd uh and it's because what people are solving is is something that is novel like it needs to be
(20:55) something novel or else nobody's going to use it and so what crypto actually uniquely solves in applying those properties of what crypto uniquely solves is something very valuable so what I said with the creatives for example like in the in the industry that Apple tackled uh with education and creators what was missing was the tools they needed in order to acclimate to the digital world uh so they didn't have quite the easy tools to develop digital art and so Apple was pushing into that audience getting more tools built in
(21:27) that ecosystem to support those artists do those things and so from our standpoint and what we think about what creators are having problems with today this is where we get into some topics that are pretty contentious but the topic of the way that AI art has damaged artists in the sense that these uh models are basically being trained on artists content that's been posted in like public websites and stuff and these artist AR being compensated for this training data and then the art that gets produced by these uh machine learning
(21:58) models is something that is so derivative but like so derivative of such a mass of different things that you can't uniquely link it to the original creators of those art pieces and so by consequence they also get no attribution they get no reward they get no attribution and they didn't get to actually have any say in whether that data is being used to train and so this is something that I focus on in the way that we're trying to promote equilibriums use and adoption because one of the unique attrib attributes of
(22:29) crypto in general is being able to have attributable ownership of data the idea that you own your data and you control your data but more specifically with a privacy preserving protocol that you control who sees your data and who can have access to your data and then compounding it a step further with the ability for decentralized compute to be able to perform things like machine learning on top of that data that you as an individual who's an artist being able to contribute that into the training models that the tagged data that
(22:59) Associates it to you flows all the way through such that when inference is run on that model it attributes the ownership of the original data that was used for the production of that particular image or that particular written work or that particular song that it flows back to the original creators so that when that inference is run and is paid for that the people involved as creators are getting a split and so that is one of the most important things to think about when we're talking about what we're trying to do what is
(23:29) unique what is it that we are trying to accomplish that broadly others have not thought about and and it's really comes down to the ability to combine the ability to compose these like other broad Concepts that are emerging in the industry and do so in ways that are unique and novel and actually solve people's problems I guess I wouldn't call it payments it would be more like uh royalties and then um regarding the quality enforcement side of things uh some people have seen some of the early uh early days of um equilibrium where we
(24:13) were um building a lot more in public we we still build in public uh that is something that I try very strongly to continue doing but the way we build in public is much more about what is like the active right now whatever the pressing moment is that people are more broadly aware of I found that when I try to build more broadly in public and start to show early designs and early um you know early projects that aren't ready for public release uh people tend to get very upset because these things of course take time and uh as I've said
(24:45) many times crypto is a very now now now now now uh State at the moment and so uh one of the things that I had shown early on was our Q console which is basically our answer to Amazon web services WS console and uh one of the things that if people paid close enough attention to what we are um introducing that's rather unique like of course we are introducing a you know encrypted end to-end version of S3 we are adding a uh multi-party computation version of Key Management Service we are basically leveraging all the unique qualities of
(25:22) kums network to provide incredible value ads to those services that we're going to be exposing through the console but one of the things that people haven't quite uh picked up on and it's probably because I haven't talked about it to a significant enough degree I haven't pointed at it but if you were observant enough you would have noticed there is a social component and that social component is actually really important because decentralization is freedom decentralization enables people to do things permissionless and as a
(25:50) consequence of that permissionless nature we have seen this industry under repeated assault through crappy scams crappy nft projects crappy icos crappy uh meme coins and as a consequence of that the industry has been harmed in ways that almost feel irreparable now again we are creating a decentralized protocol so we can't just fulfill the Nintendo seal of quality we can't just you know control what is being launched on this network it is a permissionless protocol so this has a lot of uh like something that you have to kind of feed
(26:26) back into the design of things like Q console and comes back to the question of how do you add Quality Bar to a protocol that enables people to create whatever they want in the answer is it's through exposure and so the nature of what we're doing with Q console is a decentralized application that you can manage your services in the same way that you manage things on AWS but we are exposing elements that people can use and adopt for example like let's say I made a front end for managing a decentralized exchange and I wanted to
(26:57) share that front in so that people could make remixes of it that people could plug it in as like a small component like if I'm building a if I'm building a website that has a token of its own and I want people to be able to use that token but this token's relatively new and people don't have it I could take that Dex component plug it into my own application expose that as a simple component so people can make the swap into the token that they need in order to continue their action and carry on that type of composability is something
(27:25) that AWS as a console does not expose they don't have this idea of people sharing things um but what's unique about that is that because there is an easy uh path for people to share their applications or application components in a way that developers can adopt other people's works there's a quality bar issue and so by Consequence the nature of how we are generating that social component of the Q console is going to essentially be through user adoption user voting and user engagement around these ideas and so essentially we are
(27:59) using that as a way to decentralize that Nintendo seal of quality component to help ensure that the quality bar of the things that people are using is consistently raised Higher and Higher and that social consensus is something that hasn't really been captured very well for anything yet other than actual social media and I think that that's a unique Dynamic that people haven't like really they haven't really come to terms with yet because there hasn't really been anything else that's done that yet and so I think that
(28:37) that's going to be one of those surprising moments that is going to like people will look back on and say this is what was unique this is what actually made a difference in changing the way that this industry functioned for the Long Haul and speaking of the Long Haul the way that we're thinking about things in terms of overcoming you know the the bubble that's potentially actively bursting right now we speak uh is the way in which we actually design the tokenomics of the protocol and so one of the things that people um have seen as
(29:08) histories played out of uh Bitcoin ethereum and others is that in order to have sustainable tokenomics there has to be something that thinks more in terms of the longer Generation by generation approach and so the way that we incorporate Generations into the actual consensus algorithms reward output itself is literally by measuring the uh computational speed of the network now there's been a few other projects that have basically leveraged some sort of Supply demand Dynamic and we're not quite doing that in the same way we do
(29:43) have a dynamic fee market for the nature in which uh like transactions will cost at certain points so that if you know there's a hot interval that's like causing a lot of uh friction for getting uh traffic to flow through successfully obviously the fees would rise in order to address the congestion but uh that's that's not particularly unique or novel but what is particularly unique or novel is instead of having something that is essentially like this you know depending on the protocol they do like a 10 or 20
(30:10) or 50-year Horizon where the token issuance uh flattens out if it's like a proof of work scheme or that there is a uh Economic Policy of a overtie trading percentage over time that eventually uh goes to 0% issuance and then there's just transaction fees or something as part of the nature of the protocol uh instead of doing that we've actually taken this notion of hybridizing this this proof of work system where you do have tapering issuance because there is natural stages in which the market reaches saturation and you can see that
(30:45) happening in practically every industry over the course of about 10 years over and over and over again and instead of like simply succumbing to those patterns and designing a short-term thing that will rapidly hype up it doesn't matter that it tapers off because we're just in it for a short term instead we're thinking about it for the long term that every single one of those 10year Cycles we want to actually capture the the new generation of technology that has emerged incentivize its adoption and use and then also give people a new
(31:15) opportunity as newcomers to participate meaningfully in the protocol in ways that it's very hard to do when you get into the later stages for example on bitcoin you do not have people running new miners today who have not been in the mining space to any significant degree you'll have a few hobbyists that try this you'll have a few people who will buy one of those mining Rigs and they'll try it but you don't actually have like large masses of people who are suddenly deciding I'm going to become a Bitcoin minor because realistically the
(31:42) competition bar is way too high and so mining pools have basically Consolidated into a handful of like maybe three or six or three to six uh individual organizations and they control the majority of the hash rate of the network and so that's very harmful to the economic security of the networ and so very similarly with ethereum there is the same problem with the nature of how much Capital has converged on people who are willing to put forth the effort to do validation and so by consequence you have Lio and coinbase essentially being
(32:13) over 50% of all stake Dee and you can make arguments that like these are good stewards of the of the protocol like they have no interest in engaging in malicious ways but that's not important what's important is that if the protocol is intended to be decentralized then your goal is to get as many people to actively participate in the decentralization of that protocol and not converge onto a handful of a small uh set of individuals and so this is something that we're even seeing right now in our own 2.0 release where the
(32:41) nature of how the mining algorithm currently works is something that's producing a lot of convergence that there's just you know it's getting into a smaller number of individual nodes that are participating and that is not ideal that is not something that is healthy and that is why we are pushing so hard and so fast fast to get to one where the proof of meaningful work algorithm Works in a completely different way that things are more sharded out that it is much harder for minor centralization to be a pressure of
(33:09) the network and that comes back full circle to the nature of how we are planning for the long term of the network and so these are the kinds of things that I I want people to think about like when you look at how history repeats there is this nature of people to just like not consider how those things happened and apply them to how things are currently happening because they'll just argue that this is too new this is too unique that this won't happen again in the same way and yet we just find ourselves making the same
(33:40) mistakes and making the same decisions and same outcomes ultimately emerge and so that's what's playing out today and this is how we think about the nature of how this company is meant to operate how this protocol is intended to be built and how we intend to solve some of the most severe harms that have happened to this industry um that was a pretty long ramble but I hope that helps and I'll go ahead and uh put in that last element I don't know if people are going to take screenshots of this but I did want to at least have it zoomed in so
(34:20) people could kind of like get an idea of how we talk about the stories of how history repeats itself and how that applies to Q

Lessons from the Bybit Hack Securing Crypto with Quilibrium - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt4uIQnQJD4

Transcript:
(00:00) and uh last but not least let's go ahead and tackle the design situation of Bybit so for those who have heard the news about Bybit but don't understand what happened uh Bybit is an exchange that is based out of Dubai I believe and they were hacked for 1.4 billion worth of ETH and it has since been um split laundered etc through so many different channels uh essentially it has turned North Korea into the single largest holder of ETH which is a really shitty situation to be in and so let's talk about how that hack
(00:33) actually happened and how they could prevent this and potentially how they could actually leverage something like equilibrium in order to give a greater degree of defense in depth so talking about um how the hack happened first and foremost uh if you're unfamiliar with how cold storage is supposed to work the idea is at a high level you basically have um what is called hot and cold separation of wallets so that you have a way to securely manage funds um such that your risk is significantly minimized in the event that you have
(01:05) some sort of internal compromise at your company so an exchange for example would have significantly more uh uh assets in their cold storage than they would have in their hot storage the hot storage is essentially intended to keep enough liquidity such that they are able to provide uh support for user withdrawals uh and if they do any advanced uh chain integrations being able to support those as well but like largely we're we're talking about withdrawals and so in the withdrawal scenario what happens is there is a
(01:34) certain amount of liquidity that needs to be maintained and so when you have um a lot of different crypto assets generally you tend to keep kind of like a running average of what the what the withdrawal rate is what the deposit rate is such that you're able to manage the funds so that you kind of keep your hot um hot wallets essentially balanced so you you want to maintain some sort of threshold and that threshold is basically your um your tolerance of of what you're willing to um accept or at least ensure against in the event of a hack so for
(02:09) example like I'm I'm just spitballing numbers this is probably not what they were actually setting whatever they had set is probably uh a an agreement they have maintained with whoever does the insurance for their hot storage generally exchanges will get get insurance for hot storage and won't get insurance for cold storage because cold storage is intended to be well cold and untouchable and and very safely guarded so let's talk about what's supposed to happen with that so the hot storage let's say that they have
(02:39) a let's say that they have a limit like they they have an insurance limit they will cover up to like the insurance company will cover up to $10 million in the event of a hack and they have some degree of like leeway that they're allowed to uh step over for wallet balances because simply movements happen so fast in this industry and sometimes the values of these cryptocurrencies also fluctuate very sharply um and you need to smooth around that or otherwise you're going to be constantly having to do movements and so what tends to happen
(03:09) is uh you'll have a mix of assets like we'll say this is ETH we'll say that this is uh soul say that this is bitcoin and so on and so you have your hot wallet storage uh set that you are maintaining some quantity of assets in your hot wallets okay so when you have um cold storage operations happening generally they're like they'll use some word for it like some will call it sweeps and restores some will call it uh deposits and withdrawals like they would with actual customer uh interactions with their with their hot storage it just depends it's
(04:14) whatever convention they use is is going to be uh potentially unique to them but for the sake of uh keeping things consistent for for the language I'm going to be using here uh we'll just call it uh sweeps and restores so when you are sweeping something to cold storage that's very simple the hot storage has essentially these collection of keys they live in some place that is connected to their services such that they can invoke an API call it will construct that transaction and broadcast it onchain to send that particular set
(04:44) of funds to cold storage and what you end up doing typically as a custodian is you'll have a collection of uh cold storage addresses that are associated with the particular target um assets that you're wanting to manage how each company does it is a little bit different here's what Vybit basically did they had a cold storage address or at least they said it was a cold storage address that had $1.
(05:09) 4 4 billion worth of ETH related assets that's ETH and associated like staked ETH and so on um and so when you um hit that limit here what's supposed to happen is like say that it goes over the limit it will initiate a sweep to cold storage there's a given set of public addresses that are known um in that for the cold storage wallet targets and it will create that transaction and send the funds over so far so good what's supposed to happen is when you hit essentially a low limit so like you're getting too low on funds that exist inside your uh hot wallet you
(05:48) uh initiate a restore operation and so what's supposed to happen with a cold storage operation is you have people dedicated at the company who have you know gone through incredibly deep background checks their identities are typically not known um because otherwise they'd be a target and they will perform whatever operations are necessary to restore the cold storage uh funds such that it is sent over to the hot storage wallets here's a couple of things that I could immediately pick up from uh from the like details of what they were
(06:20) giving in the call about what they've been doing wrong so and and keep in mind I also previously worked at Coinbase where I was one of the people maintaining cold storage i very intimately know how cold storage should be done and so it was it was very quick attenuation from me to have my eyebrows perk up when I heard what they were doing so here's what happened first and the first thing that went wrong when you look at the cold storage operations that they had first and foremost the wallet was not cold like just flat out the
(06:48) wallet was not cold it was a smart contract wallet called uh called Nosis Safe um and don't get me wrong Nosis Safe is a great product and used responsibly for managing smaller uh quantities of funds it's it's perfectly reasonable to use like your your risk tolerance level for a hot wallet for example nosy would be great for that but for cold storage you're immediately having two conditions that should be never done in a cold storage scenario the first is um the keys that interact with it are repeated like you keep using
(07:22) the same keys so for example these signers the way they were using Nosis safe as a cold storage is whenever they needed to do a restore operation they were proposing a new transaction such that it would move funds from the cold storage wallet on Nosis safe to the hot storage wallets and when they did that transaction proposal then they would have their uh individual key holders that were holding um I believe they said it was ledgers so those like hardware wallets that are kind of sketch um they were holding ledgers and would then do
(07:51) the signature for the multi-IG Nosis safe wallet such that once the quorum of signatures was met the transaction would be considered approved and it would meet the uh criteria for the smart contract wallet in order to move the funds from uh cold storage to uh hot storage um so that's problem number one the key is constantly being reused for the same asset one of the core principles of cold storage is that the moment that a key that manages funds is exposed in any way whether it's a signature whether it's actually like uh importing the the
(08:26) private key and using it on a hot system whatever operation you're doing the moment you expose that key to the public internet in a non-airgapped environment you have made that key hot and so when you are using Nosis safe to manage cold storage you're effectively always dealing with hot keys there is no cold key and so that was problem number one problem number two the nature of cold storage should be in order to accommodate for that kind of degree of separation that should occur should never have $1.4 billion in a single
(09:00) address and so um the way that proper cold storage should be done uh should be that you are Whoops uh you are actually splitting those funds out to reasonable bars and what is reasonable is going to be uh contingent on the operations of your given exchange but uh tends to be chunked into a given set of sizes so like let's say that you're for example like let's say that you are insured up to $10 million for a collection of addresses such that you have like maybe about $200 million in insurance coverage you would want to basically be such that
(09:35) your addresses in cold storage are maximally which of course values will fluctuate so you have to accommodate for that but essentially those cold storage addresses are bounded to a rough number like typically you will get like a weekly moving average of the price of an asset and that will be how you set your boundaries over how many coins get deposited to a given address but you will split it out into multiple addresses is such that when you ever need to do a restore operation because you have gone underneath that boundary you can safely
(10:11) take one of the cold storage keys that has been filled up and then make it hot do the restore operation and now your hot storage is uh funded back up to whatever acceptable bounds you have set and it's basically that simple um so to do that you have to actually have true cold storage operations so let's let's revisit what they were trying to do what they were trying to do is a very common um very common way to derisk the nature of having multiple addresses or or having any address in cold storage and exposing it to the web the moment
(10:52) you have an address that is exposed to the internet you run the risk that there is some brilliant attacker out there that may take advantage of um whatever vulnerabilities are available in order to redirect those funds and so they try to have a defense in depth by using Nosis safe to manage these operations such that in order to compromise that interaction it requires multiple signers of that wallet to actually agree to that transaction well sure enough that's exactly what happened so the nature of the attack was each one of these uh
(11:24) signers for bybit was actually given a forged interface they're basically their machine was compromised such that the signature proposal they received looked like their typical cold storage restoration operations but they weren't they signed this operation essentially a they were given a fake display that showed like it was just normal operations but the actual thing that they signed was basically giving over control of the Nosis safe wallet such that the attacker could then drain all the funds um so that's that's basically
(11:56) like one of the common things that you design your cold storage around is such that that can't happen uh and the way you do that is by having it as airgapped as humanly possible like you're not going to have this like ability for things to gently uh interact on occasion you don't have developers with their their primary work laptops interacting with cold storage funds like that's just not how you do it so instead what you do is you have basically a hard set of operations that are uh completely compartmentalized
(12:31) so you create software that generates keys uh those keys that are generated are generated using MPC processes that split them out into shards uh one of the most common in fact practically the only way that people do it is called um shamir secret sharing um but there is actually a special variant that adds a greater degree of security and it's something that equilibrium uses outright for uh distributed key generation uh in the network and that's called uh Feldman verifiable secret sharing i've talked about it before in previous broadcasts
(13:01) but basically it's that each party is running their own instance of um um the secret shamir secret sharing and then they're basically constructing samples of that polomial for each participant they add them together they create their individual samplings they emit their um public points of those samplings with a zero knowledge proof attached to it to show that they did not cheat and then also at the end everybody combines their public sampling such that you now have a verifiable result that this like every participant behaved honestly and every
(13:32) participant can reconstruct the same key but none of them actually have the full private key and so that's like some really fun mathematics that are great about MPC now if you're wanting to do cold storage you would not do this MPC on the internet you would do this NPC potentially in a tent so like for example the way that Coinbase does it and there's there's actually public articles about it i'm not giving any secret details um we would actually set up Faraday tents out in San Francisco where we would actually have like you
(14:03) know completely shielded off from the world you'd have laptops spun up that are fresh laptops that are procured from sources that you know should be reasonable that they can't be tampered with we would load it with AC it would run the key generation process create the shards and then we would actually print out those shards and store them basically in a physical vault um and then the actual like digital assets like the the the laptops themselves like the the things that generate the digital assets I should should say those uh
(14:31) laptops themselves are then shredded every single bit of this is completely asserted that it cannot leave the tent um if it has touched key material except for the physical paper because paper can't be hacked and so um that's that's basically the principle so that is the degree of minimization that for a custodian that is managing billions of dollars of assets that's what you should do now to make this work in the equilibrium context and where it actually matters let's talk about the restoration process so say that you have
(15:05) those pieces of paper stored in the vault and maybe you have um you know separated it out such that there's different vaults that hold all the shards for greater degree of protection so that if your vault was actually physically compromised um they would have to hit each vault in order to obtain those shards and reconstruct the cold keys and and do the actual theft um in the Q context that's actually a lot easier to do because instead of having to um manage the reconstruction of these shards by having like some sort of
(15:36) physical location where everybody brings those sheets of paper together or scans them uploads them whatever uh instead of having to do that you actually just utilize the uh key management service such that you are posting those individual shards to each other in a given ceremony so the way that that operation works is that you have an import key step so you will create these um I'll just use this to denote a split key so you have your key splits and then um what is previously done in like the old oops old school cold
(16:20) storage you then have a step where these um are basically uploaded and combined all in one step so they get uploaded to like some private service that does the reconstruction and then um at the same time does whatever signature operation needs to happen and maybe they'll use something like a TE to um give a chain of custody that the signature operation that is being uh performed as something that has been audited and signed off on and you end up with a signature output that moves the key and the key is now essentially considered dead because the
(16:58) funds have been transferred from it and the key splits are now useless uh and so that's the that's the old school output uh you get a signature and that's that's basically it you broadcast it to a chain and you're done um so when you're wanting to move away from that into something that is a bit more resilient because keep in mind that trusted execution environment as an example is something that can be compromised tees have been hacked plenty of times private services have been exploited plenty of times if every single thing you're
(17:25) trying to do with handling uh cold storage is to minimize your degree of weakest links this is where uh you can actually get to using Q as a cold storage system because instead of doing that you now have a signature method that is actually um performing a series of checks and the way that you deploy applications to the network is something that essentially provides uh a deterministic uh check that cannot be violated so like I have created an application it is essentially existing solely for the purpose of taking key
(18:01) shards and creating a transaction that transaction is a transfer function of um you know of ETH on the Ethereum mainet uh here's all the details of it and it resolves to a like static hash that is unforgeable so you can verify based on that information that those key shards are supposed to go there but even better you can actually make those in advance such that when you are creating these keys splits and you are storing any sort of associated metadata to be managed on cold storage when you use it on Q you are doing so such that you are creating
(18:33) identifiers that are unforgibly bound to only do that one transfer function when the time comes and so that basically sets the purpose of the key to something more specific than what Amazon KMS could even do but also more secure than what even traditional cold storage that's very very high security could be doing and certainly way more secure than whatever the hell BBIT was doing with Nosis safe so when you do that you then um upload those key shards individually to this transfer function but remember inputs on Q are private so when you are
(19:06) doing this interaction what's actually happening behind the scenes is you are constructing a garbled circuit and executing it such that each individual party is participating in this garbled circuit where those key values are being merged and a signature is being formed without ever revealing those private inputs to one another um and then you end up getting the output um through the magic of NPC you end up getting a signature output which means that the only place in time where key material is actually being exposed is now limited to
(19:47) individual locations that are intrinsically bound on purpose of what those keys can even do that basically eliminates every single opportunity for an attacker to actually take advantage of these keys splits the only only thing you would have to prevent is the secure restoration of those keys splits and uploading and integrating with that particular uh cold storage signing process that's way better security than what is happening here and so that's that's basically it these are the things I wanted to run through tonight um I
(20:20) felt like these were important to talk about especially because of all the news that's been ongoing um next week we're going to be going through a lot more a lot more news i thought that some of this was going to happen this week but some things take a little longer than expected so we'll get to that when it happens and I'll be excited to share it when I can um in the meantime uh I will stick around for a few to uh see if anybody has any questions otherwise we'll wrap it up and call it a night

Transcript:
(00:01) um they St stated equilibrium remains a bootstrapped project with no VC backing while this is great for decentralization how do you ensure long-term sustainability are there plans for funding grants or other strategic Partnerships um so simply put we're in the process of fundraising with accredited investors uh we specifically I should note that we are not you know making any statements or asks for investors in this particular AMA uh that is not how we operate we operate within the confines of the law under the United
(00:31) States um and are explicit stances no token warrants and no willingness to engage with investors that demand them there are many VCS who do not demand these we talk to them so let me break down the long-term sustainability question in relation to funding grants strategic Partnerships funding and grants are common components of coins that have pre- allocations we didn't do this we had a completely Fair launch Q Inc had to run miners in the same equal rules that everyone else had and by consequence we have well under percent
(00:59) or well under one % of the total tokens on the network our position on the use of tokens is not um has not changed as a utility token we do not engage or encourage speculation of the token our purpose in holding the token is to utilize the network for its endend purposes one of these cases is quarum and other cases also include things like providing AWS compatible Services uh and in additional like intrinsics that we want to put on the network for supporting things like uh machine learning what we do intend to do is to
(01:28) help developers on board um and provide a free tier of access to these compatible services so people can see the ease of switching over and even begin to do so before having to actually put any money towards it and so in that same vein we have been of course you know when we were running miners in the earlier days we choose not to right now because things are so complicated and nebulous that we don't want to um you know potentially be seen as having a strategic Advantage when we don't but we still don't want to create that type of
(01:57) narrative so we don't run miners right now um but we we do want to at least be able to have the token Supply that we currently have as Q Inc in order to facilitate the utility of the network that we are going to be providing through these uh SD

(00:00) this um that style of thing and then finally our MPC uh machine learning library now this one is a little bit interesting for some other reasons and this is the first thing that I'm going to actually show some data on today this is going to be the first time I'm showing any data around this u these numbers are subject to change uh but the performance of this was just too too hot to handle and I have to I have to show it to others uh essentially we are relying on an entirely different form of u machine learning like the way that
(00:31) we're conducting machine learning to fulfill functions like your your traditional softmax and everything is done in a way that is actually functional on CPUs and there's a lot of research behind it and I'm not going to dive into the full details of that because uh frankly I'm not ready to give away the the secret sauce to what we're doing yet um but as all of our components on Q it will be of course open source uh AGPL licensed so sorry any other competitors that want to leverage this for your own tech if you
(00:58) do try to use it uh you will be bound to the AGPL license and you will have to contribute back and that's kind of our uh mantra of our infectious license um but let's go ahead and hop over to it um oh I have Excel draw of course um so what is in this graph is kind of one of the most uh powerful graphs I've ever seen in terms of the things that we've been building in terms of raw performance um what you're essentially looking at is a standard data set that's been trained using a model that works on uh traditional TensorFlow
(01:28) implementations and so in this graph you're seeing at the bottom is the amount of time in seconds that it's taking to train it's a relatively small model uh only 670k uh parameters but it takes on a CPU implementation of TensorFlow a very long time like we're talking about 50,000 uh seconds just to train this very small model and on a uh V100 it takes you know little bit less time this is a logarithmic graph so it's still you know we're still talking about hours and then finally on something like the A100 you end up with a still faster
(02:02) time but our implementation in What makes this so crazy and so like I have to I have to shout it from the rooftops before uh we actually publish it is that it's actively competitive against an A100 using traditional CPUs and the reason is that we're not doing the same types of matrix multiplication techniques that uh A100s do or V100s or any other implementations of traditional models the the way that we're introduc or or we're performing this mathematics is through a another thing and I'm not saying what that other thing is yet um
(02:36) if you've been a reader of AI papers for a while you may actually know what I'm talking about but um there there is an interesting different technique to implement these same exact functions in a way that works on CPUs is incredibly efficient and what is most important for equilibrium is the fact that it can also be encrypted and so in other words these operations can be working on encrypted data without revealing the private inputs of that data and it works well in an MPC scheme and it still retains the performance and that is the absolute
(03:06) killer element to it and so that's the one thing that I wanted to bring up because that's something that a lot of uh people have been asking about which is how are we going to be um oh yeah sure we can zoom in um how are we going to be operating in a uh machine learning world um when machine learning is very slow for uh multi-party computation which is why a lot of multi-party computationoriented projects end up just shoving it in a TE this is how and so uh I can't wait to actually publish the full paper on what is being called Claro

06 - The biggest risk to Quilibrium's success - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVW23b_2SGM

Transcript:
(00:01) um what is the biggest risk to equilibrium success  and how are you addressing it uh I also will Loop   in the question from quill fans as well uh it's  the basically the same thing honestly what will   be the greatest difficulty in the process of quill  success um so to answer that the biggest risk to   equilibrium success is its usage and we're  directly addressing that uh that's why we're   pushing hard on growing the application that made  equilibrium need to exist in the first place uh   rolling out API compatible Services also to help  companies that to address their own existential
(00:31) risks to help them also succeed speaking to the  risk factor um in different axes though on product   Quorum is constantly growing in usage in less than  3 weeks the state of the application has grown   more weekly active users than most crypto social  products including several who've raised tens of   millions of dollars from VCS but even for the apps  out there with more social or more active users   at the moment our feature set has now outclassed  all of them um and if you're if you're not using
(01:00) of these apps you probably don't know that that's  the case or you maybe don't believe me so I'm   actually going to show you um let me illustrate  with the uh state of the industry currently with   one of the poster children for chat based apps  uh XMP their team raised 50 million um over two   rounds uh here let me pull up what I experienced  when I was trying to see what it was like to on   board and and use it so uh yeah their team raised  uh nearly $50 million and given who's on their cap   table you already know the answer to did they take  a token warrant question um they partnered with
(01:38) a staggering number of big names and by virtue of  those Integrations they boast 2 million connected   users to their accounts the number is actually  19 million but they remove any accounts with no   connected e identities uh and although they  don't broad uh although yeah actually that's   that's such a weird thing to me they don't boast  their actual um usage they don't talk about how   many messages go over their Network and so so  uh I'm going to show you why so uh this is uh   a screenshot of um what it's like to use xmt on  one of the biggest connected applications coinbase
(02:15) wallet if I can drag it up here this is what it's  like it's it's just all Spam um I have had maybe   a couple uh messages that have actually come over  XMP on coinbase wallet and uh that's that's about   it this is this is what it's like to actually  use that product um and then their Flagship   application um Converse which enables things like  group conversations uh is is currently so buggy   that sometimes you'll have messages that pop on  top of your own messages and it goes in and out   of order in super weird ways but um it's not it's  not very usable and uh I I've previously had other
(03:01) criticisms about them but uh these are some of  the most egregious um I also have some questions   about the the security of their approaches but  we'll we'll get to some of that in a sec um so now that uh now that I've got all that uh shown  um I'd like to remind you for a second that's $50   million of crypto VC money at work uh compared  to Q which you know we've got around in progress   not yet closed some people call us a onev team  even though that's not really true we're working   from our cave with a box of scraps and if you've  seen quum messenger the difference is night and
(03:39) day um I want to also just take a moment because  I do actually know the founder of XMP so Shane if   you're watching I really only mean this comparison  to demonstrate what's table Stakes for a chat app   it's not meant to be a drag targeting your team  I know you've got a brilliant team I've talked to   them before obviously I I pitched triple ratchet  to you guys um every single crypto chat app on the   market until Quorum has came out has basically  been exactly like this so I have imense respect
(04:07) for you and your team it's just a demonstration  of the current situation and behavior
